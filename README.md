# opendkim
The DKIM project which can check your domain keys against a database of recognised entries

A special thanks to "https://github.com/LordVeovis/docker-opendkim" where I found the solution for enabling mysql access for opendkim to store and check the keys there

## Important
You must install the database component beforehand because this relies on the database to check for user accounts
